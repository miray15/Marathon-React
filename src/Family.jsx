          Baba and I didn't get along. We had different perspectives on life.
          But that didn't mean I didn't want to have a loving relationship with
          my father just as anyone would. When I was finally ready to see him,
          it was too late. I met at him for the first time in 8 years at his
          casket. Heart disease robbed me of the potential to develop a positive
          relationship with my dad.
