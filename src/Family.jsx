          My mom died. My world shattered. The most supportive person in my life
          was gone. I&apos;d listen to her voicemails just to hear her voice. It
          didn&apos;t take long for me to learn that the void she left behind
          would never go away - I would just get used to it.

          My dad wanted the best for me, and worked hard to design a future
          where I would be successful. He learned to bake the best bread, make
          wheels of cheese he shared with family and friends, and loved me
          endlessly.
