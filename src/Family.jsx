          When my mom died my sophomore year of college, I went into shock for
          six months. An entire semester had passed where I floated through the
          world, disconnected from my feelings. In January, I crashed. I skipped
          2 weeks of classes and hid. I would never receive a text that ended in
          "luv u mama". I would never hear her voice, taste her food, or rest my
          head on her shoulder. I nearly dropped out of college, but I wanted to
          graduate to fulfill my promise to her.
